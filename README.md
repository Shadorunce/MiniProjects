# MiniProjects
This will be a portfolio basiclly for my random school work projects to see if there's anything of interest, or my work file that I've created if it might be useful for anyone.

I will first be adding a section for my COP1000 class, then separate per chapter of what I have done. When I get the chance I plan on completing the other tutorials and projects so I can have more to show off, and better test my skills.
